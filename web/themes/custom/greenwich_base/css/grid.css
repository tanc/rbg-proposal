/*
  This is a basic grid system, that should be very easy to use.
  To use, simply add an element with a class of .lgd-row, then add
  another element as a direct descendant(s) of this with the widths
  you want:
   - .lgd-row__full
   - .lgd-row__three-quarters
   - .lgd-row__two-thirds
   - .lgd-row__one-half
   - .lgd-row__one-third
   - .lgd-row__one-quarter

  In some cases, this might mean adding more templates than we want, so
  we have further classes that will give the same result by adding a modifier
  class to the parent .lgd-row element (e.g. <div class="lgd-row lgd-row--halves">).
  - .lgd-row--halves - direct descendants are all 50% each
  - .lgd-row--thirds - direct descendants are all 33% each
  - .lgd-row--quarters - direct descendants are all 25% each
*/
.lgd-row > * {
  margin-right: calc(var(--grid-column-spacing) / 2);
  margin-left: 0;
}
